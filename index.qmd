# 1. OPENING: Fork in the Road + Cooking Metaphor {.section}

## We're at a critical choice point with AI

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Is AI going to own us?**

**Or are we going to own AI?**
:::

## The Pattern Repeats

We've been here before:

- Windows → locked in
- Office → locked in
- WhatsApp → locked in
- ArcGIS → locked in

::: {.fragment}
**Now it's happening with AI**
:::

## Let me show you what lock-in looks like...

Imagine you want to cook a meal...

## Proprietary Recipe Card

```
PROPRIETARY RECIPE CARD

1. Add 2 units of Compound-XJ7
   ($15/bottle, our brand only)
2. Heat in Model-Pro-Pan-2024 at setting "MEDIUM"
3. Stir with Certified-Stirring-Tool
   (sold separately)
4. Add Flavor-Packet-B when indicator light turns green

⚠️ WARNING:
- Substitutions void warranty
- Recipe breaks if ingredients discontinued
- Do not attempt to understand the chemistry
- Model-Pro-Pan-2024 discontinued next year; upgrade required
```

## Open Recipe Card

```
OPEN RECIPE

1. Sauté onions in oil until translucent
   WHY: Releases sugars, builds flavor base

2. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds
   WHY: Aromatic, cooks fast, burns easily

3. Add tomatoes, simmer 20 min
   WHY: Breaks down, concentrates

NOTES:
- No onions? Use shallots or leeks
- Olive oil or butter both work
- Any pan that conducts heat evenly
```

## The Absurdity

::: {.r-fit-text}
Would you accept the proprietary system for cooking?

**Of course not!**
:::

## But We DO Accept This for Software

::: {.r-fit-text}
And now we're doing it with AI
:::

## Time Comparison

![](images/time-comparison.png){fig-alt="Bar chart showing cooking 30-60 min/day vs computer use 4-8 hours/day"}

**Yet we accept ignorance about technology**

::: {.notes}
TODO: Create bar chart visual showing time spent cooking vs using computers
:::

## The Vulnerability

Once you've invested in ChatGPT Plus...

- Learned their interface
- Built your prompts in their system
- Stored your data with them

::: {.fragment}
**Switching cost becomes ENORMOUS**
:::

## Quick Check

::: {.incremental}
- How many use ChatGPT? 🙋
- How many run local LLMs? 🙋
- Why not? Let's explore that.
:::

## Transition

::: {.r-fit-text}
Today: I want to show you there **IS** an alternative
:::

- Open source LLMs you can run locally
- For teaching
- On your own hardware

# 2. UNDERSTANDING LLMs: Pragmatic Overview {.section}

## What Are LLMs? (Practical Overview)

## What LLMs Are (Simple)

- Sophisticated pattern matching from massive text
- Like very advanced autocomplete
- Not "intelligence" - pattern recognition at scale

::: {.fragment}
**Not magic - technology you can understand**
:::

## The Last 5 Years

![](images/llm-timeline.png){fig-alt="Timeline of LLM development 2019-2025"}

- **2019:** GPT-2 impressive but limited
- **2023:** ChatGPT changes everything
- **2024-2025:** Open models catch up

::: {.fragment}
**Key insight: Gap closing FAST**
:::

::: {.notes}
TODO: Create timeline visual
:::

## Proprietary vs Open Weights

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Proprietary**
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

- Runs on their servers
- They see your data
- You pay subscription
- They control access
- Can change/remove features
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Open Weights**
(Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)

- Runs on YOUR hardware
- Your data stays local
- One-time hardware cost
- You control everything
- Stable, predictable
:::
:::

## "Good Enough" is Good Enough

You don't need the absolute **best** model

::: {.incremental}
- You need one that solves YOUR problem
- With YOUR data privacy intact
- At YOUR cost structure
- Under YOUR control
:::

## The Three Enhancements

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
**RAG**

Retrieval Augmented Generation

Give LLM access to YOUR documents

*Example: IUNR course materials, research papers*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**MCPs**

Model Context Protocol

Connect LLM to your tools

*Example: Field data, GIS, email, calendar*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Personas**

System Prompts

Shape how LLM behaves

*Example: "Teaching assistant for environmental science"*
:::
:::

## Why Local Makes Sense for Teaching

- Student data is **sensitive** (GDPR, privacy)
- **Repetitive tasks** (grading, feedback)
- Custom **course materials** (RAG)
- One-time setup, **ongoing value**
- **No per-query costs**

## Transition

::: {.r-fit-text}
Okay, so what can you **actually DO** with this?
:::

# 3. TEACHING USE CASES + BENCHMARKS {.section}

## What Can Local LLMs Do For Teaching?

## Use Case 1: Generate Practice Questions

**Input:** Lecture slides or textbook chapter

**Output:** 10 multiple choice questions with explanations

**Why local:** Course materials often proprietary/sensitive

---

**Benchmark:**

```
ChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Local DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Privacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS
```

## Use Case 2: Student Writing Feedback

**Input:** Student essay or report

**Output:** Constructive feedback on structure, argument, clarity

**Why local:** Student work is confidential

---

**Benchmark:**

```
ChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Local DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Privacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS
```

## Use Case 3: Summarize Research

**Input:** 30-page research paper

**Output:** 1-page summary for students

**Why local:** Can process many papers, no API costs

---

**Benchmark:**

```
ChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Local DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Privacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS
```

## More Use Cases

Other tasks that work well locally:

- Translate technical content to different reading levels
- Create interactive study guides with RAG
- Generate grading rubrics
- Answer student questions about course materials

## The Key Insight

- Local models are **"good enough"** for teaching tasks
- Quality gap has **closed dramatically**
- Privacy advantage is **huge**
- Cost: Hardware once, then **unlimited use**

## Transition to Demo

::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's see this in action
:::

# 4. LIVE DEMO {.section}

## Demo Intro

**Let's See It In Action**

- I'll run BOTH ChatGPT and local Ollama
- YOU give me a teaching task
- We'll compare results

## Demo Setup

::: {.notes}
Split screen or side-by-side
Same prompt to both
Real-time comparison

Possible demo tasks:
- Generate 5 exam questions from a text snippet
- Give feedback on a short student paragraph
- Summarize a research abstract
:::

[LIVE DEMO SCREEN]

## Demo Debrief

::: {.r-fit-text}
Same capability, different backends

One you control, one you don't

Both work for teaching tasks
:::

# 5. WHY OPEN SOURCE MATTERS {.section}

## Why Control Matters

## Two Times You Were Betrayed

**Example 1: WhatsApp Leak**

- Billions of phone numbers exposed
- "You trusted them with your data"
- Everyone uses it, personal stakes

---

**Example 2: Windows 10 Obsolescence**

- Hardware made "obsolete" by software decision
- Environmental waste, e-waste crisis
- Forced upgrades, no choice

## The Lock-in Pattern

```
         Cognitive Lock-in
         (I only know THIS)
              ╱│╲
             ╱ │ ╲
   Technical│  │ Institutional
   (Format) │  │ (Everyone uses it)
```

## Father's Photo + Global Justice

![](images/father-linux-1998.jpg){fig-alt="Linux workshop in Sri Lanka, 1998"}

"This has always mattered - licensing costs exclude entire regions"

**Open source = global equity**

## The AI Choice is NOW

- In 2-3 years, everyone locked into ChatGPT like WhatsApp?
- Or will we preserve alternatives?

::: {.fragment}
**This window won't stay open forever**
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Good news:** Open models exist NOW
:::

## Recipe Callback

::: {.r-fit-text}
Remember the proprietary recipe?

Would you accept that for cooking?

**Then why accept it for AI?**
:::

# 6. INTERACTIVE MOMENT {.section}

## Your Use Cases

::: {.r-fit-text}
What would YOU use local LLMs for in your teaching?
:::

::: {.notes}
Quick brainstorm (show of hands or call-outs)
Capture 3-5 ideas verbally
Validate: "Yes, that would work!"
:::

## Where Are You Locked In?

**Which tools feel hardest to escape?**

::: {.notes}
Quick discussion (2-3 people share)
"That's the lock-in we're talking about"
"Local LLMs can help break some of those chains"
:::

# 7. CLOSING: The Invitation {.section}

## Return to Fork in the Road

::: {.r-fit-text}
We started with a choice

**Is AI going to own us, or do we own AI?**
:::

## You Have Options

- Open weight models exist
- Hardware is capable (even laptops)
- Tools are maturing (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Community is growing

::: {.fragment}
**YOU can do this**
:::

## Address the Objection

"I don't have time to learn this!"

::: {.incremental}
- Yes, initial investment needed
- But: Pays off over time
- And: You're no longer vulnerable
:::

::: {.fragment}
*Cooking callback: Worth learning to cook vs. proprietary recipes*
:::

## Start Small

Try **ONE** thing this month:

- Install Ollama and run a model
- Generate one set of exam questions locally
- Test a local LLM for summarizing
- Explore LM Studio or similar tools
