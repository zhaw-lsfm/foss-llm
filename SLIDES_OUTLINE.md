## OPENING: The Proprietary Cooking System (7 min) - Slides 1-10

**1. Title Slide**

- Title: "Technology Sovereignty"
- Subtitle: "Who Controls Your Digital Tools?"
- Your name, GrüentAI logo

**2. Opening Question**

- "Imagine you want to cook a meal..."

**3. Proprietary Recipe Card (FULL SLIDE VISUAL)**

```
PROPRIETARY RECIPE CARD

1. Add 2 units of Compound-XJ7 ($15/bottle, our brand only)
2. Heat in Model-Pro-Pan-2024 at "MEDIUM"
3. Stir with Certified-Stirring-Tool (sold separately)
4. Add Flavor-Packet-B when light turns green

⚠️ WARNING:
- Substitutions void warranty
- Recipe breaks if ingredients discontinued
- Do not attempt to understand the chemistry
- Pan discontinued next year - upgrade required
```

**4. Open Recipe Card (FULL SLIDE VISUAL - CONTRAST)**

```
OPEN RECIPE

1. Sauté onions in oil until translucent
   WHY: Releases sugars, builds flavor base
2. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds
   WHY: Aromatic, cooks fast, burns easily
3. Add tomatoes, simmer 20 min
   WHY: Breaks down, concentrates

NOTES:
- No onions? Use shallots or leeks
- Olive oil or butter both work
- Any pan that conducts heat evenly
```

**5. Question to Audience**

- "Would you accept the proprietary system for cooking?"
- "Why not?"
- Bullet points of objections

**6. The Pivot**

- "But we DO accept this for software"
- Large text, dramatic

**7. Time Comparison (VISUAL)**

- Bar chart or simple graphic:
  - Cooking: 30-60 min/day
  - Computer use: 4-8 hours/day
- "Yet we accept ignorance about technology but not cooking"

**8. Vendor Lock-in Trap**

- "Once you've invested..."
- List: Model-Pro-Pan ($200), 12 bottles Compound-XJ7 ($180), Certified-Stirring-Tool ($50)
- "Switching cost becomes ENORMOUS"
- "You are now VULNERABLE"

**9. WhatsApp Validation**

- "How many use WhatsApp daily?" (show of hands)
- "How many use Signal?" (show of hands)
- "Why not switch?"

**10. Transition**

- "This is vendor lock-in"
- "Keep the cooking metaphor in mind - we'll return to it"

## THE FRAMEWORK: Understanding Lock-in (6 min) - Slides 19-26

**19. Section Title**

- "Understanding Lock-in"

**20. Three Layers (DIAGRAM)**

```
Interface Layer    → "I can use Word" / "I can follow the recipe"
     ↕
Implementation     → Open vs. Proprietary / Any ingredients vs. Their ingredients
     ↕
Technology         → Text editing capability / Cooking process
```

**21. Cooking Metaphor Mapping**

- Recipe = Interface
- Ingredients = Implementation
- Cooking = Technology
- "You can know the recipe without understanding cooking"

**22. Lock-in Triangle (DIAGRAM)**

```
         Cognitive Lock-in
         (I only know THIS way)
              ╱│╲
             ╱ │ ╲
   Technical │  │ Institutional
   (Format)  │  │ (Everyone uses it)
```

**23. Examples Everyone Knows - Part 1**

- WhatsApp vs Signal
- Google Maps vs OpenStreetMap
- (Icons/logos for visual recognition)

**24. Examples Everyone Knows - Part 2**

- ArcGIS vs QGIS
- Microsoft Office vs LibreOffice
- Podcast (iTunes vs RSS)
- (Icons/logos for visual recognition)

**25. Export Difficulty Contrast**

- Proprietary: Hard to export, obscure formats, trap your data
- Open Source: Easy export, lists alternatives on their website!

**26. Examples of Export**

- WhatsApp chat export (painful) vs Signal (easy)
- ArcGIS vs QGIS
- EndNote vs Zotero

## THE FORK IN THE ROAD: AI Moment (4 min) - Slides 31-34

**31. Section Title**

- "We're At A Fork In The Road"

**32. The Key Question (LARGE TEXT)**

- "Is AI going to own us?"
- "Or are we going to own AI?"

**33. Two Paths (SPLIT VISUAL)**

Left side - Path 1: Corporate Control

- They decide what we can do
- They set the terms
- We pay their prices
- We're dependent on their decisions
- Pattern repeats: Windows → Office → ArcGIS → ChatGPT

Right side - Path 2: Democratic Technology

- Open models anyone can run
- Local control over your data
- Customize for your needs
- Not beholden to corporate decisions
- True technological sovereignty

**34. The Urgency**

- "This choice happens NOW. In the next 2-3 years."
- "Will everyone be locked into ChatGPT like WhatsApp?"
- "The window won't stay open forever"
- GOOD NEWS: Open models exist NOW, hardware is capable NOW

## UNDERSTANDING LLMs: Demystifying the Magic (6 min) - Slides 35-40

**35. Section Title**

- "Understanding LLMs: Not Magic, Technology"

**36. What LLMs Are**

- Sophisticated pattern matching, not magic
- Like very advanced autocomplete
- Trained on massive text datasets
- Not "intelligence" - pattern recognition at scale

**37. The Last 5 Years (TIMELINE VISUAL)**

- 2019: GPT-2 impressive but limited
- 2023: ChatGPT changes everything
- 2024-2025: Open models catch up
- Key insight: Gap closing FAST

**38. Open Weights vs Open Source**

- Open weights: You can download and run the model
- Different from fully open source (training code, data)
- But still: YOU control it, not a company
- Examples: Llama, DeepSeek-r1, Mistral

**39. Enhancing LLMs - The Ecosystem (DIAGRAM)**

Three components:

- **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
  - Give LLM access to YOUR documents
  - Example: IUNR course materials

- **MCPs** (Model Context Protocol)
  - Connect LLM to your tools and data
  - Example: Field data, GIS systems

- **Personas/System Prompts**
  - Shape how LLM behaves
  - Example: "You are a teaching assistant for environmental science"

**40. Why Understanding Matters**

- Not magic → Technology you can shape
- Not monolithic → Modular components
- Not proprietary only → Open alternatives exist
- Not all-or-nothing → Right tool for each task
