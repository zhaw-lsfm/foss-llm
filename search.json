    "text": "Target Audience: IUNR researchers and teachers (mixed tech literacy: “simple mail users” → power users) Duration: 60 minutes fixed Format: Empowering, slightly provocative awareness session + hands-on demo Language: English working document, will translate to German later\n\n\n\n\nMake audience realize: “I’m a product user, not a technology wielder - and that’s a problem”\nDesired outcome: - Be more adventurous in trying alternatives - Remove fear of switching costs - Realize it’s worth trying something different - Know GrüentAI team as a resource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Absurd Proprietary Cooking System:\nImagine you want to cook a meal, but you can only follow recipes from one specific provider. The recipe card looks like this:\nPROPRIETARY RECIPE CARD:\n\n1. Add 2 units of Compound-XJ7 (available only from us, $15/bottle)\n2. Heat in Model-Pro-Pan-2024 at setting \"MEDIUM\"\n3. Stir with Certified-Stirring-Tool (sold separately)\n4. When indicator light turns green, add Flavor-Packet-B\n\n⚠️ WARNING:\n- Substitutions void warranty\n- Recipe may stop working if ingredients discontinued\n- Do not attempt to understand the chemical processes involved\n- Model-Pro-Pan-2024 will be discontinued next year; upgrade required\nContrast with Open Source Cooking:\nOPEN RECIPE:\n\n1. Sauté onions in oil until translucent\n   (WHY: releases sugars, builds flavor base)\n2. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds\n   (WHY: aromatic, cooks fast, burns easily)\n3. Add tomatoes, simmer 20 min\n   (WHY: breaks down, concentrates)\n4. Season to taste\n\nNOTES:\n- No onions? Try shallots or leeks (similar aromatic base)\n- Olive oil or butter both work (you need fat for flavor)\n- Any pan that conducts heat evenly\n- Adjust time based on your stove's heat output\nKey Questions to Audience:\n\n“Would you accept this for cooking?”\n\nOf course not! It’s absurd!\nYou’d want to understand WHY each step works\nYou’d want to substitute based on what you have\nYou’d want freedom to adapt to YOUR needs\n\n“But we DO accept this for software. Why?”\n\nTime argument: “We spend FAR more time on computers than cooking”\nMost people cook 30-60 min/day\nMost people use computers 4-8 hours/day\nYet we accept ignorance about technology but not about cooking\n\n“What about someone who doesn’t know how to cook?”\n\nThey might say: “It’s going to take me ages just deciding on a pan!”\n“How should I find the time to learn all that?”\nSame with software: Yes, initial investment needed\nBUT: It pays off many-fold over time\nAnd you’re NOT vulnerable anymore\n\n\nThe Vulnerability of Lock-in (Vendor Lock-in via Cooking):\nOnce you’ve bought: - The Model-Pro-Pan-2024 ($200) - 12 bottles of Compound-XJ7 ($180) - The Certified-Stirring-Tool ($50) - Learned their obscure ingredient names - Built up a recipe collection that ONLY works with their system\nYou are now in a vulnerable position: - Switching cost is enormous - you’d have to replace everything - They can raise prices - you’re already invested - They can discontinue products - your recipes break - They control your ability to cook - you’re dependent\nSound familiar? This is exactly how software lock-in works.\nMapping to Software Reality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking Metaphor\nSoftware Reality\n\n\n\n\n“Compound-XJ7”\nProprietary file formats (.docx, .psd, etc.)\n\n\n“Model-Pro-Pan-2024”\nSpecific OS/hardware requirements\n\n\nRecipe only works with their stuff\nVendor lock-in, no interoperability\n\n\nCan’t substitute ingredients\nCan’t switch tools/platforms\n\n\nDon’t know WHY it works\nClosed source, black box systems\n\n\nIngredient discontinued = recipe breaks\nSoftware sunset = your workflow dies\n\n\nUnderstanding cooking basics\nUnderstanding technology principles\n\n\nCan adapt recipe to YOUR context\nCan modify open source for YOUR needs\n\n\nVulnerable after investment\nTrapped by switching costs\n\n\n\nThe Empowerment Message:\nWhen you understand the BASICS of cooking: - “Oh, I’m building a flavor base - I can use what I have” - “This is creating an emulsion - milk works too” - “I’m at high altitude, I need to adjust” - You become empowered, not dependent\nWhen you understand the BASICS of technology: - “Oh, this is just a text editor - I can use any one” - “This is file synchronization - multiple tools do this” - “I need privacy - I’ll choose the open alternative” - Same empowerment, same freedom\nHow to Use Throughout Workshop:\n\nOpening hook: Start with this scenario, get them reacting\nWhen explaining lock-in: “Remember the proprietary recipe? That’s what’s happening here.”\nInfuriating examples: “WhatsApp leak? You trusted the recipe provider and they exposed your data.”\nFramework section: “Three layers: Recipe (interface), Ingredients (implementation), Cooking process (technology)”\nSwitching costs: “You’ve invested in their pans and ingredients - now you’re stuck”\nClosing: “Would you accept proprietary cooking? Then why accept proprietary software?”\n\n\n\n\n\nFather’s Photo (1998 Linux Workshop, Sri Lanka) - Open Source vs proprietary matters for global justice - Licensing costs exclude entire regions - This is not a new problem\nAda & Zangemann Story - Brief overview with openly licensed images - Shows the pattern: inventor controls devices, kids hack freedom - Makes the concept accessible and narrative\nInfuriating Examples (make them feel the anger!)\nFINAL SELECTION - 3 Concrete Examples: 1. WhatsApp security flaw - Billions of phone numbers exposed (Wired article) - Everyone uses it, personal stakes - Shows you can’t trust platforms you don’t control - Links to opening: “Why not Signal? THIS is why.” 2. ICC prosecutor email block - Microsoft blocked emails after Trump sanctions - Corporate platforms can censor at will - Global justice implications 3. Windows 10 forced obsolescence - Hardware made “obsolete” by software - Environmental waste, e-waste crisis - Resonates with IUNR environmental focus\n(Other candidates considered but dropped: Academic paywalls - separate issue; Field data/ArcGIS - not concrete enough)\n\n\n\nThree Layers:\nInterface Layer    → \"I know how to use ChatGPT\"\nImplementation     → Open vs. proprietary\nTechnology         → The fundamental capability\nLock-in Triangle:\n     Cognitive Lock-in\n         ╱│╲\n        ╱ │ ╲\nTechnical│  Institutional\nExamples Everyone Knows: - WhatsApp vs Signal - Google Maps vs OpenStreetMap - Podcast via iTunes vs RSS feed - ArcGIS vs QGIS - Microsoft Office vs LibreOffice - [More to brainstorm]\n\n\n\n“LLMs are another lock-in risk we need to avoid”\nAND: “LLMs are tools that let you WIELD difficult technologies without mastering proprietary interfaces!”\nThe Promise:\n\nUse tools more easily with AI assistance\nBuild custom solutions for YOUR needs\nDemocratize technical capability\nBreak down barriers to open source adoption\n\n\n\n\nShow real value for their work:\nUse Cases to Demonstrate:\n\nGenerate practice questions from lecture materials\nProvide feedback on student writing\nTranslate technical content to different levels\nSummarize research papers for students\nCreate interactive study guides\nAssist with grading rubrics\n\nBenchmark Format:\nTask: [Specific teaching task]\n\nChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [Result]\nLocal Llama3.3:   ⭐⭐⭐⭐  [Result]\nLocal DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [Result]\n\nPrivacy: Local wins\nCost: Local wins\nSpeed: ChatGPT slightly faster\nQuality: Nearly equivalent\n\n\n\nShow in slides (not interactive): - Proprietary: Hard to export, obscure formats, lock your data - Open Source: Easy export, lists alternatives on their websites!\nExamples: - WhatsApp chat export (painful) vs Signal (easy) - ArcGIS export process vs QGIS - EndNote vs Zotero\n\n\n\nKey Framing Question: “We are at a critical moment in history. AI is becoming ubiquitous. The question is: Is AI going to own us, or are we going to own AI?”\nThe Choice:\n\nPath 1: AI remains controlled by a few tech corporations\n\nThey decide what we can do\nThey set the terms\nWe pay their prices\nWe’re dependent on their decisions\nPattern repeats: Windows, Office, ArcGIS → now AI\n\nPath 2: AI becomes a democratic technology\n\nOpen models anyone can run\nLocal control over your data\nCustomize for your needs\nNot beholden to corporate decisions\nTrue technological sovereignty\n\n\nThe Urgency: “We’re making this choice RIGHT NOW. In 5 years, will everyone be locked into ChatGPT the way they’re locked into WhatsApp? Or will we preserve alternatives?”\nWhy This Moment Matters:\n\nOpen weight models are NOW available (DeepSeek-r1, Llama3.3)\nHardware is NOW capable (you can run them locally)\nThe window won’t stay open forever\nFirst-mover advantage creates lock-in\n\n\n\n\nPurpose: Make LLMs less “magic” and more “technology you can understand and control”\nComponents to Explain (Accessible to Mixed Audience):\nA. Training a Language Model - The Basics - What is a “word embedding”? (Words as coordinates in meaning-space) - High-level concept: Model learns patterns from massive text - Like a very sophisticated autocomplete - Not “intelligence” - pattern matching at massive scale\nB. The Last 5 Years: Explosive Progress - 2019: GPT-2 was impressive but limited - 2023: ChatGPT changes everything - 2024-2025: Open models catch up to proprietary ones - Key insight: The gap is closing FAST\nC. “Open Weights” vs “Open Source” - Open weights: You can download and run the model - Different from fully open source (training code, data) - But still: YOU control it, not a company - Examples: Llama, DeepSeek-r1, Mistral\nD. AI Safety Concerns (Rob Miles Perspective) - LLMs can be manipulated (trigger words, jailbreaks) - Example: Specific phrases that make models behave unexpectedly - Why it matters: If you don’t control the model, you don’t know what’s happening - Local models: You can inspect, test, understand\nE. Enhancing LLMs: The Ecosystem\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): - Give the LLM access to specific documents - Makes it accurate for YOUR domain - Example: Feed it IUNR course materials, then ask questions - You control what knowledge it uses\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol): - Let LLMs interact with your tools and data - Connects AI to your existing workflows - Example: LLM that can access your field data, GIS systems - Standardized way to extend capabilities\nPersonas/System Prompts: - Shape how the LLM behaves - “You are a teaching assistant for environmental science” - Customizable for specific tasks - You control the personality and focus\nF. Why Understanding This Matters - Not magic → Technology you can shape - Not monolithic → Modular components you can swap - Not proprietary only → Open alternatives exist - Not all-or-nothing → Use the right tool for each task\nKey Message: “LLMs are powerful but they’re not magic. Once you understand the components, you realize: you can build this yourself, customize it, control it. That’s the difference between being a user and being a wielder.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal time: 60-65 minutes (may need slight adjustment)\n\n\nStart with the absurd scenario: - “Imagine you could only cook using one company’s recipes…” - Show the proprietary recipe card (visual slide) - Show the open recipe (visual slide) - Key questions: “Would you accept this? No! Why not?”\nThen pivot to software: - “But we DO accept this for software” - Time argument: “We spend 4-8 hours/day on computers, 30-60 min cooking” - “Yet we accept ignorance about technology but not cooking”\nThe vulnerability point: - “Once you’ve invested in their pans, ingredients, learned their system…” - “Switching cost becomes enormous - you’re trapped” - This is vendor lock-in\nQuick WhatsApp validation: - “How many use WhatsApp daily? Signal?” - “Why not switch? EXACTLY - switching costs” - “Keep the cooking metaphor in mind - we’ll come back to it”\n\n\n\n\nFather’s photo: 1998, Sri Lanka, licensing costs matter\nAda & Zangemann: The pattern of control vs. freedom (brief!)\nInfuriating examples with cooking callbacks:\n\nWhatsApp leak: “You trusted the recipe provider with your data - they exposed it”\nICC block: “The recipe provider decided you can’t cook anymore”\nWindows waste: “Your pan is ‘obsolete’ because they say so”\n\nThe arc: This has always mattered (1998) → It’s a pattern (Ada) → It’s urgent NOW\n\n\n\n\n\nThree layers with cooking parallel:\n\nInterface: “I can follow the recipe” → “I can use Word”\nImplementation: Proprietary vs open (their ingredients vs any ingredients)\nTechnology: The cooking process itself → The fundamental capability\n\nLock-in triangle\nExamples: Maps, Podcasts, ArcGIS, WhatsApp\nExport difficulty: Proprietary traps vs Open Source liberates\nCooking callback: “Recipe (interface), Ingredients (implementation), Cooking (technology)”\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Flipcharts with stars\nSetup: - Multiple flipcharts with pre-printed tool pairs/triplets - Examples: - Messaging: WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram - Maps: Google Maps / OpenStreetMap / Apple Maps - GIS: ArcGIS / QGIS - Office: MS Office / LibreOffice / Google Docs - Stats: SPSS / R / Python - Reference: EndNote / Zotero / Mendeley - [More as needed]\nActivity: - 5 min: Everyone walks around, adds stars to tools they use - 5 min: Look at the patterns together - 5 min: Debrief - “What surprised you? Where’s the concentration?”\nKey insight: “See how we’re clustered on proprietary? That’s collective lock-in.”\n\n\n\n“We’re at a choice point with AI”\n\nSame pattern is forming with LLMs RIGHT NOW\nQuestion: “Is AI going to own us, or are we going to own AI?”\nPath 1: Corporate control (repeat of WhatsApp/Windows/ArcGIS)\nPath 2: Democratic technology (open models, local control)\nUrgency: “This choice happens in the next 2-3 years. The window won’t stay open.”\nGood news: Open models exist NOW, hardware is capable NOW\n\n\n\n\n“Let’s understand what we’re talking about”\nQuick explainer (accessible): - What LLMs are: Sophisticated pattern matching, not magic - Last 5 years: Explosive progress, gap closing fast - Open weights: You can download and run them locally - Components that enhance them: - RAG: Give it access to your documents (e.g., course materials) - MCPs: Connect to your tools (e.g., field data, GIS) - Personas: Customize behavior for your needs - Key point: “Not magic → technology you can understand and control”\n\n\n\n“This is why LLMs matter for sovereignty”\n\nLLMs make technology ACCESSIBLE without mastering proprietary interfaces\nYou can now WIELD difficult tools with AI assistance\nWrite custom solutions for YOUR needs\nDemocratizes technical capability\n\nTeaching Use Cases + Benchmarks (quick overview): - Generate exam questions - Provide feedback on student writing - Summarize research papers - Show benchmarks: Local models nearly match ChatGPT quality - Advantage: Privacy, cost, control\nGrüentAI connection: “We’re making this real for teaching - and we’re here as a resource”\n\n\n\nYOU run both ChatGPT and local Ollama THEY give you prompts\nShow both things: 1. Same task, different backend (technical point) 2. LLM helps you use open source tools (liberation point)\nPossible demo: - Generate exam questions from a text (teaching use case) - Show both produce good results - “Same technology, different products - and YOU control one of them”\n\n\n\n\nReturn to cooking metaphor: “Would you accept proprietary cooking? No! So why accept proprietary software?”\n“We’re at the fork in the road. Which path do we take?”\nAddress the ‘I don’t have time’ objection:\n\n“Learning to ‘cook’ with technology takes initial investment”\n“But it pays off many-fold over time”\n“And you’re no longer vulnerable to vendor decisions”\n\n“Switching costs are real, but so is the cost of staying locked in”\n“Try one new open alternative this month - start small”\nGrüentAI is here as a resource for questions\n“We’ve gained knowledge on this, you can contact us”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal: 65 minutes - slightly over.\nChanges with cooking metaphor: - Opening extended from 5→7 min (worth it for strong hook) - Personal Stakes shortened from 8→7 min (Ada can be briefer) - Net change: Still at 65 minutes\nOptions to fit 60 minutes: 1. Tighten Framework section (6→5 min) 2. Compress Understanding LLMs (6→5 min) 3. Acknowledge workshop may run 65 min with discussion 4. Make Understanding LLMs optional/backup slides\nRecommendation: The cooking metaphor is so strong, keep the 7 min opening. Compress Understanding LLMs to 5 min to compensate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Teaching Use Cases Section: - Where does it fit in the flow? - Option A: Before demo (shows why you should care) - Option B: After Activity 1 (bridges lock-in to practical value) - Option C: Integrated into demo (demo IS the use case) - How many use cases to show? - Deep dive on 1-2 with live demo - Quick overview of 5-6 on slides - Let audience choose which to demo - Benchmark presentation format? - Pre-tested results on slides (safe) - Live head-to-head comparison (powerful but risky) - Video recording of comparisons (backup plan)\n2. “Anger Moments” Selection: ✅ RESOLVED - WhatsApp security flaw (billions exposed - personal stakes, everyone uses it) - ICC prosecutor email block (corporate censorship, global justice) - Windows 10 obsolescence (environmental waste - resonates with IUNR focus)\n3. Example Collection: Need more tool pairs that resonate with IUNR. Brainstorm: - Field data collection tools? - Statistical software? - Specialized environmental science tools? - Communication/collaboration tools?\n4. Personal Elements Placement: - Father photo: One powerful moment - where? - Ada & Zangemann: How brief? Just story or deeper dive? - Infuriating examples: Quick succession or focus on one?\n\n\n\n5. Activity 1 Flipcharts: - How many flipcharts total? - What tool categories to include? - Format: Large paper? Digital display? - Visualization: Just count stars or create a pattern?\n6. Activity 2 Demo: - Which teaching use case to demo live? - Backup plan if tech fails? - How much audience participation vs watching?\n\n\n\n7. Materials Needed: - Flipcharts + markers - Laptop with ChatGPT and Ollama running - Slides (to be created) - Backup videos/screenshots if demo fails - Handouts? (TBD)\n8. Risk Mitigation: - Local LLM demo fails during workshop - Audience is more/less technical than expected - Time management if discussions run long - Pushback: “But proprietary tools are just better”\n\n\n\n\n\nRole in Workshop: “This is why this workshop is possible - we’ve gained knowledge on this topic and are people you can contact if you have questions”\nNOT: “Let us tell you about our amazing project” BUT: “We’re working on this problem and we’re a resource for you”\nCall to action: - Try alternatives - Reach out with questions - Optional: Participate in testing (if relevant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalize teaching use cases to showcase (TABLED - see notes in Open Questions)\nSelect 2-3 most powerful “anger” examples (WhatsApp leak, ICC block, Windows waste)\nDecide on benchmark presentation approach\nDetermine teaching content placement in flow (TABLED - see notes in Open Questions)\nComplete example collection (tool pairs) - IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate slide deck\nDesign flipchart templates\nPrepare and test live demo\nCreate benchmark visualizations\nWrite facilitator script\nPrepare backup materials\nTest full workshop timing\nTranslate to German\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✓ Empowering over scolding ✓ Concrete over abstract ✓ Visual/hands-on over passive listening ✓ Their experience first, theory second ✓ Action-oriented - they should DO something after ✓ Accessible to simple mail users AND power users ✓ Emotional connection (father, Ada, anger) + practical value (teaching use cases)\n\nThis document captures the current high-level design. Once we finalize these structural decisions, we’ll drill down into detailed content, slides, and scripts."

Enhancing LLMs: The Ecosystem\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): - Give the LLM access to specific documents - Makes it accurate for YOUR domain - Example: Feed it IUNR course materials, then ask questions - You control what knowledge it uses\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol): - Let LLMs interact with your tools and data - Connects AI to your existing workflows - Example: LLM that can access your field data, GIS systems - Standardized way to extend capabilities\nPersonas/System Prompts: - Shape how the LLM behaves - “You are a teaching assistant for environmental science” - Customizable for specific tasks - You control the personality and focus\nF. Why Understanding This Matters - Not magic → Technology you can shape - Not monolithic → Modular components you can swap - Not proprietary only → Open alternatives exist - Not all-or-nothing → Use the right tool for each task\nKey Message: “LLMs are powerful but they’re not magic. Once you understand the components, you realize: you can build this yourself, customize it, control it. That’s the difference between being a user and being a wielder.”"

    "text": "Total time: 60-65 minutes (may need slight adjustment)\n\n\nStart with the absurd scenario: - “Imagine you could only cook using one company’s recipes…” - Show the proprietary recipe card (visual slide) - Show the open recipe (visual slide) - Key questions: “Would you accept this? No! Why not?”\nThen pivot to software: - “But we DO accept this for software” - Time argument: “We spend 4-8 hours/day on computers, 30-60 min cooking” - “Yet we accept ignorance about technology but not cooking”\nThe vulnerability point: - “Once you’ve invested in their pans, ingredients, learned their system…” - “Switching cost becomes enormous - you’re trapped” - This is vendor lock-in\nQuick WhatsApp validation: - “How many use WhatsApp daily? Signal?” - “Why not switch? EXACTLY - switching costs” - “Keep the cooking metaphor in mind - we’ll come back to it”\n\n\n\n\nFather’s photo: 1998, Sri Lanka, licensing costs matter\nAda & Zangemann: The pattern of control vs. freedom (brief!)\nInfuriating examples with cooking callbacks:\n\nWhatsApp leak: “You trusted the recipe provider with your data - they exposed it”\nICC block: “The recipe provider decided you can’t cook anymore”\nWindows waste: “Your pan is ‘obsolete’ because they say so”\n\nThe arc: This has always mattered (1998) → It’s a pattern (Ada) → It’s urgent NOW\n\n\n\n\n\nThree layers with cooking parallel:\n\nInterface: “I can follow the recipe” → “I can use Word”\nImplementation: Proprietary vs open (their ingredients vs any ingredients)\nTechnology: The cooking process itself → The fundamental capability\n\nLock-in triangle\nExamples: Maps, Podcasts, ArcGIS, WhatsApp\nExport difficulty: Proprietary traps vs Open Source liberates\nCooking callback: “Recipe (interface), Ingredients (implementation), Cooking (technology)”\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Flipcharts with stars\nSetup: - Multiple flipcharts with pre-printed tool pairs/triplets - Examples: - Messaging: WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram - Maps: Google Maps / OpenStreetMap / Apple Maps - GIS: ArcGIS / QGIS - Office: MS Office / LibreOffice / Google Docs - Stats: SPSS / R / Python - Reference: EndNote / Zotero / Mendeley - [More as needed]\nActivity: - 5 min: Everyone walks around, adds stars to tools they use - 5 min: Look at the patterns together - 5 min: Debrief - “What surprised you? Where’s the concentration?”\nKey insight: “See how we’re clustered on proprietary? That’s collective lock-in.”\n\n\n\n“We’re at a choice point with AI”\n\nSame pattern is forming with LLMs RIGHT NOW\nQuestion: “Is AI going to own us, or are we going to own AI?”\nPath 1: Corporate control (repeat of WhatsApp/Windows/ArcGIS)\nPath 2: Democratic technology (open models, local control)\nUrgency: “This choice happens in the next 2-3 years. The window won’t stay open.”\nGood news: Open models exist NOW, hardware is capable NOW\n\n\n\n\n“Let’s understand what we’re talking about”\nQuick explainer (accessible): - What LLMs are: Sophisticated pattern matching, not magic - Last 5 years: Explosive progress, gap closing fast - Open weights: You can download and run them locally - Components that enhance them: - RAG: Give it access to your documents (e.g., course materials) - MCPs: Connect to your tools (e.g., field data, GIS) - Personas: Customize behavior for your needs - Key point: “Not magic → technology you can understand and control”\n\n\n\n“This is why LLMs matter for sovereignty”\n\nLLMs make technology ACCESSIBLE without mastering proprietary interfaces\nYou can now WIELD difficult tools with AI assistance\nWrite custom solutions for YOUR needs\nDemocratizes technical capability\n\nTeaching Use Cases + Benchmarks (quick overview): - Generate exam questions - Provide feedback on student writing - Summarize research papers - Show benchmarks: Local models nearly match ChatGPT quality - Advantage: Privacy, cost, control\nGrüentAI connection: “We’re making this real for teaching - and we’re here as a resource”\n\n\n\nYOU run both ChatGPT and local Ollama THEY give you prompts\nShow both things: 1. Same task, different backend (technical point) 2. LLM helps you use open source tools (liberation point)\nPossible demo: - Generate exam questions from a text (teaching use case) - Show both produce good results - “Same technology, different products - and YOU control one of them”\n\n\n\n\nReturn to cooking metaphor: “Would you accept proprietary cooking? No! So why accept proprietary software?”\n“We’re at the fork in the road. Which path do we take?”\nAddress the ‘I don’t have time’ objection:\n\n“Learning to ‘cook’ with technology takes initial investment”\n“But it pays off many-fold over time”\n“And you’re no longer vulnerable to vendor decisions”\n\n“Switching costs are real, but so is the cost of staying locked in”\n“Try one new open alternative this month - start small”\nGrüentAI is here as a resource for questions\n“We’ve gained knowledge on this, you can contact us”"

Example Collection: Need more tool pairs that resonate with IUNR. Brainstorm: - Field data collection tools? - Statistical software? - Specialized environmental science tools? - Communication/collaboration tools?\n4. Personal Elements Placement: - Father photo: One powerful moment - where? - Ada & Zangemann: How brief? Just story or deeper dive? - Infuriating examples: Quick succession or focus on one?\n\n\n\n5. Activity 1 Flipcharts: - How many flipcharts total? - What tool categories to include? - Format: Large paper? Digital display? - Visualization: Just count stars or create a pattern?\n6. Activity 2 Demo: - Which teaching use case to demo live? - Backup plan if tech fails? - How much audience participation vs watching?\n\n\n\n7. Materials Needed: - Flipcharts + markers - Laptop with ChatGPT and Ollama running - Slides (to be created) - Backup videos/screenshots if demo fails - Handouts? (TBD)\n8. Risk Mitigation: - Local LLM demo fails during workshop - Audience is more/less technical than expected - Time management if discussions run long - Pushback: “But proprietary tools are just better”"

Shape how the next generation understands that technology 2. Create institutional dependencies that last decades 3. Either enable or constrain future flexibility 4. Model critical engagement (or passive consumption)\nThe university’s responsibility: &gt; Teach students how to think with technology, not just how to use products.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Small groups (3-4 people), sticky notes\nInstructions: &gt; “In your groups, you have 8 minutes. Think about the technologies you use in your work—not just software, but any technology.” &gt; &gt; “For each one, write on sticky notes:” &gt; - What’s the product/brand you use? (e.g., “ChatGPT”, “Windows”, “ArcGIS”) &gt; - What’s the underlying technology? (e.g., “LLM”, “operating system”, “GIS”) &gt; - Could you switch to an alternative tomorrow? Why or why not? &gt; - Rate your switching cost: Low / Medium / High\nExample template:\n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│ Product: _____________     │\n│ Technology: __________     │\n│ Alternative exists?

(file formats, training, workflows?) - Where do we have agency vs. where are we stuck?\nKey Insight to Draw Out: “Notice how often the barrier isn’t technical capability—it’s learned patterns and institutional inertia.”\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Presentation connecting to the project\n\n\nIt’s not just about: - Privacy ✓ (but yes, important) - Cost savings ✓ (but yes, nice to have) - Technical cool factor ✓ (but yes, it’s cool)\nIt’s fundamentally about: &gt; Preserving institutional autonomy and teaching technology literacy\n\n\n\nWhat we’re building: Not “a local ChatGPT clone” but rather “institutional LLM literacy”\nFour workflows - designed for sovereignty:\n\nPrüfungsunterstützung\n\nDesign prompts that work across LLM implementations\nDocument what’s model-specific vs. general\nStudents learn “LLM-assisted assessment” not “ChatGPT assessment”\n\nBewertungsunterstützung\n\nTemplate-based approaches that aren’t tied to specific APIs\nTransparent: students see when AI is used and can understand why\nTransferable: works with local or cloud models\n\nLiteraturarbeiten\n\nOpen formats for knowledge representation\nRAG systems that aren’t locked to one LLM backend\nSkills in evaluating LLM outputs, regardless of source\n\nKollaborative Lernunterstützung\n\nExpose when we use local vs. cloud models and why\nLet users choose implementations based on their needs\nBuild meta-skills: “when is which implementation appropriate?”\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal LLMs          Commercial LLMs       Hybrid Approaches\n(GrüentAI focus)    (still available)     (smart routing)\n     │                    │                      │\n     └────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘\n                          │\n              \"LLM Technology Literacy\"\n\nUsers learn: When to use what, and why\nNot just: How to use one specific tool\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Same small groups, design challenge\nThe Challenge: &gt; “Pick one of the four GrüentAI workflows. Your task: Design it in a way that maximizes technology literacy and minimizes vendor lock-in.”\nGuiding Questions: - What should users learn? (The product interface or the underlying process?) - Where do you need a specific implementation vs. where can you be agnostic? - How do you make the “technology layer” visible to users? - What would make this workflow portable to other LLM implementations?\nExample Starter (for Prüfungsunterstützung):\n❌ Don't: \"Here's how to use ChatGPT to write exam questions\"\n✓ Do: \"Here's how to prompt an LLM for exam questions—we'll show you with both local and commercial models\"\n\n❌ Don't: Build workflows that only work with OpenAI's API\n✓ Do: Use abstraction layers that can switch backends\n\n❌ Don't: Hide what the LLM is doing\n✓ Do: Make it transparent, teach critical evaluation\nGroup Share-out (5 minutes): - Quick pitch from each group (1 minute) - What principles emerged?\nFacilitator Synthesis: Write common themes on board: - Transparency over black boxes - Teach the “why” not just the “how” - Build with interoperability in mind - Give users agency and choice - Make abstractions visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Idea: &gt; Technology sovereignty isn’t about being anti-commercial or anti-convenience. &gt; It’s about preserving institutional agency and building technology literacy instead of product dependency.\nFor GrüentAI specifically:\nThis project is really about three things:\n\nDemonstrating: LLMs are a technology class, not a single product\nPreserving: The ability to make choices based on current needs, not historical lock-in\nTeaching: Critical engagement with AI tools, not passive consumption\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\nNot: “ZHAW uses local LLMs for everything”\nBut: “ZHAW faculty and students understand LLMs as a general technology, can work with multiple implementations, and make informed choices about when to use what”\n\n\n\nQuestions for the team:\n\nDoes this framing resonate with you?\nWhere do you see tensions between this principle and practical constraints?\nHow do we balance “teach technology literacy” with “get things done efficiently”?\nWhat would make this principle actionable in your specific institute/teaching?\n\n\n\n\nFor the GrüentAI project: - Phase 1 (April-May): Hardware setup & model testing - With this lens: Test not just performance but interoperability\n\nPhase 2 (June-August): Workflow development\n\nWith this lens: Design for portability and transparency\n\nPhase 3 (September-October): Evaluation\n\nWith this lens: Measure not just quality but technology literacy gains\n\nPhase 4 (November-December): Transfer & scaling\n\nWith this lens: Documentation emphasizes principles, not just procedures\n\n\nCall to Action: &gt; “As we build GrüentAI, we’re not just implementing technology—we’re making choices about the relationship between our institution and AI tools for years to come. Let’s make those choices intentionally.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00-0:05 → Opening hook & demo\n0:05-0:20 → Framework presentation\n0:20-0:35 → Activity 1: Spot the Lock-in\n0:35-0:45 → GrüentAI application\n0:45-0:55 → Activity 2: Design challenge\n0:55-1:00 → Wrap-up\n\n\n\n\n\nLaptop with:\n\nChatGPT or Claude access\nLocal Ollama running\nPresentation slides\n\nFlipchart/whiteboard + markers\nSticky notes (3 different colors recommended)\nHandout with three-layer framework diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nIf demo fails: Have screenshots ready\nIf timing runs over: Activity 2 can be homework\nIf group is small (&lt;6): Do activities as full group discussion\nIf group is large (&gt;20): Add more time for share-outs\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t let the framework get too theoretical - Always tie back to concrete examples\nActivity 1 is the heart - This is where people have their “aha” moment about their own dependencies\nValidate concerns - People will raise “but we need to use X because…” - acknowledge this, don’t dismiss\nMake it about agency, not purity - We’re not saying “never use commercial tools,” we’re saying “understand what you’re choosing”\n\n\n\n\nQ: “But ChatGPT is just better than local models—isn’t this fighting reality?” A: “Right now, yes, GPT-4 often performs better. But: (1) That gap is closing rapidly, (2) ‘Better’ depends on your use case—local models are better for privacy-sensitive data, (3) The point isn’t ‘never use ChatGPT’ but ‘understand it as one option among many.’”\nQ: “Isn’t this just extra work for the sake of ideology?” A: “It’s not ideology—it’s risk management. Ask yourself: What happens if OpenAI raises prices 10x? Changes terms? Gets acquired? Goes away? Institutions that built their entire teaching infrastructure around one vendor are vulnerable. We’re building resilience.”\nQ: “Students just want to learn the tools employers use—that’s ChatGPT.” A: “True today. But in 5 years? 10 years? We’re teaching students who’ll work for 40+ years. Teaching them ‘how to think with LLMs’ is more valuable than ‘how to use ChatGPT 2025.’ Plus, employers actually want people who can adapt to their tools, not just know one consumer product.”\nQ: “How do we balance this with just getting work done?” A: “This isn’t all-or-nothing. We’re not saying ‘never use commercial tools.’ We’re saying ‘when we teach, make the technology layer visible. When we build infrastructure, prioritize interoperability. When we make choices, do it consciously.’ Small design choices add up.”\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately after: - Share the GruentAI_Technology_Sovereignty_Principle.md document - Send photos of flipcharts/sticky note outcomes - Create a shared doc for ongoing reflections\nWithin a week: - Synthesize themes from activities into project planning - Share concrete examples of “sovereignty-first” design from other institutions - Set up working session to apply principles to specific workflow designs\nOngoing: - Make this a recurring checkpoint: “Is this design decision preserving or reducing our sovereignty?” - Document examples of when we successfully maintained portability - Celebrate wins (e.g., “This workflow works with 3 different LLM backends!”)"

Shape how the next generation understands that technology 2. Create institutional dependencies that last decades 3. Either enable or constrain future flexibility 4. Model critical engagement (or passive consumption)\nThe university’s responsibility: &gt; Teach students how to think with technology, not just how to use products.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Small groups (3-4 people), sticky notes\nInstructions: &gt; “In your groups, you have 8 minutes. Think about the technologies you use in your work—not just software, but any technology.” &gt; &gt; “For each one, write on sticky notes:” &gt; - What’s the product/brand you use? (e.g., “ChatGPT”, “Windows”, “ArcGIS”) &gt; - What’s the underlying technology? (e.g., “LLM”, “operating system”, “GIS”) &gt; - Could you switch to an alternative tomorrow? Why or why not? &gt; - Rate your switching cost: Low / Medium / High\nExample template:\n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│ Product: _____________     │\n│ Technology: __________     │\n│ Alternative exists?

(file formats, training, workflows?) - Where do we have agency vs. where are we stuck?\nKey Insight to Draw Out: “Notice how often the barrier isn’t technical capability—it’s learned patterns and institutional inertia.”\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Presentation connecting to the project\n\n\nIt’s not just about: - Privacy ✓ (but yes, important) - Cost savings ✓ (but yes, nice to have) - Technical cool factor ✓ (but yes, it’s cool)\nIt’s fundamentally about: &gt; Preserving institutional autonomy and teaching technology literacy\n\n\n\nWhat we’re building: Not “a local ChatGPT clone” but rather “institutional LLM literacy”\nFour workflows - designed for sovereignty:\n\nPrüfungsunterstützung\n\nDesign prompts that work across LLM implementations\nDocument what’s model-specific vs. general\nStudents learn “LLM-assisted assessment” not “ChatGPT assessment”\n\nBewertungsunterstützung\n\nTemplate-based approaches that aren’t tied to specific APIs\nTransparent: students see when AI is used and can understand why\nTransferable: works with local or cloud models\n\nLiteraturarbeiten\n\nOpen formats for knowledge representation\nRAG systems that aren’t locked to one LLM backend\nSkills in evaluating LLM outputs, regardless of source\n\nKollaborative Lernunterstützung\n\nExpose when we use local vs. cloud models and why\nLet users choose implementations based on their needs\nBuild meta-skills: “when is which implementation appropriate?”\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal LLMs          Commercial LLMs       Hybrid Approaches\n(GrüentAI focus)    (still available)     (smart routing)\n     │                    │                      │\n     └────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘\n                          │\n              \"LLM Technology Literacy\"\n\nUsers learn: When to use what, and why\nNot just: How to use one specific tool\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat: Same small groups, design challenge\nThe Challenge: &gt; “Pick one of the four GrüentAI workflows. Your task: Design it in a way that maximizes technology literacy and minimizes vendor lock-in.”\nGuiding Questions: - What should users learn? (The product interface or the underlying process?) - Where do you need a specific implementation vs. where can you be agnostic? - How do you make the “technology layer” visible to users? - What would make this workflow portable to other LLM implementations?\nExample Starter (for Prüfungsunterstützung):\n❌ Don't: \"Here's how to use ChatGPT to write exam questions\"\n✓ Do: \"Here's how to prompt an LLM for exam questions—we'll show you with both local and commercial models\"\n\n❌ Don't: Build workflows that only work with OpenAI's API\n✓ Do: Use abstraction layers that can switch backends\n\n❌ Don't: Hide what the LLM is doing\n✓ Do: Make it transparent, teach critical evaluation\nGroup Share-out (5 minutes): - Quick pitch from each group (1 minute) - What principles emerged?\nFacilitator Synthesis: Write common themes on board: - Transparency over black boxes - Teach the “why” not just the “how” - Build with interoperability in mind - Give users agency and choice - Make abstractions visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Idea: &gt; Technology sovereignty isn’t about being anti-commercial or anti-convenience. &gt; It’s about preserving institutional agency and building technology literacy instead of product dependency.\nFor GrüentAI specifically:\nThis project is really about three things:\n\nDemonstrating: LLMs are a technology class, not a single product\nPreserving: The ability to make choices based on current needs, not historical lock-in\nTeaching: Critical engagement with AI tools, not passive consumption\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\nNot: “ZHAW uses local LLMs for everything”\nBut: “ZHAW faculty and students understand LLMs as a general technology, can work with multiple implementations, and make informed choices about when to use what”\n\n\n\nQuestions for the team:\n\nDoes this framing resonate with you?\nWhere do you see tensions between this principle and practical constraints?\nHow do we balance “teach technology literacy” with “get things done efficiently”?\nWhat would make this principle actionable in your specific institute/teaching?\n\n\n\n\nFor the GrüentAI project: - Phase 1 (April-May): Hardware setup & model testing - With this lens: Test not just performance but interoperability\n\nPhase 2 (June-August): Workflow development\n\nWith this lens: Design for portability and transparency\n\nPhase 3 (September-October): Evaluation\n\nWith this lens: Measure not just quality but technology literacy gains\n\nPhase 4 (November-December): Transfer & scaling\n\nWith this lens: Documentation emphasizes principles, not just procedures\n\n\nCall to Action: &gt; “As we build GrüentAI, we’re not just implementing technology—we’re making choices about the relationship between our institution and AI tools for years to come. Let’s make those choices intentionally.”"

But: (1) That gap is closing rapidly, (2) ‘Better’ depends on your use case—local models are better for privacy-sensitive data, (3) The point isn’t ‘never use ChatGPT’ but ‘understand it as one option among many.’”\nQ: “Isn’t this just extra work for the sake of ideology?” A: “It’s not ideology—it’s risk management. Ask yourself: What happens if OpenAI raises prices 10x? Changes terms? Gets acquired? Goes away? Institutions that built their entire teaching infrastructure around one vendor are vulnerable. We’re building resilience.”\nQ: “Students just want to learn the tools employers use—that’s ChatGPT.” A: “True today. But in 5 years? 10 years? We’re teaching students who’ll work for 40+ years. Teaching them ‘how to think with LLMs’ is more valuable than ‘how to use ChatGPT 2025.’ Plus, employers actually want people who can adapt to their tools, not just know one consumer product.”\nQ: “How do we balance this with just getting work done?” A: “This isn’t all-or-nothing. We’re not saying ‘never use commercial tools.’ We’re saying ‘when we teach, make the technology layer visible. When we build infrastructure, prioritize interoperability. When we make choices, do it consciously.’ Small design choices add up.”"

Title Slide\n\nTitle: “Technology Sovereignty & Local LLMs”\nSubtitle: “Who Controls Your AI Tools?”\nYour name, GrüentAI logo\n\n2. The Fork in the Road\n\n“We’re at a critical choice point with AI”\nLarge text: “Is AI going to own us, or are we going to own AI?”\n\n3. The Pattern Repeats\n\nWe’ve been here before:\n\nWindows → locked in\nOffice → locked in\nWhatsApp → locked in\nArcGIS → locked in\n\n“Now it’s happening with AI”\n\n4. Opening Question - Cooking\n\n“Let me show you what lock-in looks like…”\n“Imagine you want to cook a meal…”\n\n5. Proprietary Recipe Card (FULL SLIDE VISUAL)\nPROPRIETARY RECIPE CARD\n\n1. Add 2 units of Compound-XJ7 ($15/bottle, our brand only)\n2. Heat in Model-Pro-Pan-2024 at \"MEDIUM\"\n3. Stir with Certified-Stirring-Tool (sold separately)\n4. Add Flavor-Packet-B when light turns green\n\n⚠️ WARNING:\n- Substitutions void warranty\n- Recipe breaks if ingredients discontinued\n- Do not attempt to understand the chemistry\n- Pan discontinued next year - upgrade required\n6. Open Recipe Card (FULL SLIDE VISUAL - CONTRAST)\nOPEN RECIPE\n\n1. Sauté onions in oil until translucent\n   WHY: Releases sugars, builds flavor base\n2. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds\n   WHY: Aromatic, cooks fast, burns easily\n3. Add tomatoes, simmer 20 min\n   WHY: Breaks down, concentrates\n\nNOTES:\n- No onions? Use shallots or leeks\n- Olive oil or butter both work\n- Any pan that conducts heat evenly\n7. The Absurdity\n\n“Would you accept the proprietary system for cooking?”\n“Of course not!”\n\n8. The Pivot\n\n“But we DO accept this for software”\n“And now we’re doing it with AI”\n\n9. Time Comparison (VISUAL)\n\nBar chart:\n\nCooking: 30-60 min/day\nComputer use: 4-8 hours/day\nAI use: Growing daily\n\n“Yet we accept ignorance about technology”\n\n10. The Vulnerability\n\n“Once you’ve invested in ChatGPT Plus…”\n“Learned their interface…”\n“Built your prompts in their system…”\n“Stored your data with them…”\n“Switching cost becomes ENORMOUS”\n\n11. WhatsApp Validation\n\n“How many use ChatGPT?” (show of hands)\n“How many run local LLMs?” (show of hands)\n“Why not? Let’s explore that.”\n\n12. Transition\n\n“Today: I want to show you there IS an alternative”\n“Open source LLMs you can run locally”\n“For teaching. On your own hardware.”\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Section Title\n\n“What Are LLMs? (Practical Overview)”\n\n14. What LLMs Are (Simple)\n\nSophisticated pattern matching from massive text\nLike very advanced autocomplete\nNot “intelligence” - pattern recognition at scale\nNot magic - technology you can understand\n\n15. The Last 5 Years (TIMELINE)\n\n2019: GPT-2 impressive but limited\n2023: ChatGPT changes everything\n2024-2025: Open models catch up\nKey insight: Gap closing FAST\n\n16. Proprietary vs Open Weights\nTwo columns:\nLEFT: Proprietary (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) - Runs on their servers - They see your data - You pay subscription - They control access - Can change/remove features\nRIGHT: Open Weights (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) - Runs on YOUR hardware - Your data stays local - One-time hardware cost - You control everything - Stable, predictable\n17. “Good Enough” is Good Enough\n\nYou don’t need the absolute best model\nYou need one that solves YOUR problem\nWith YOUR data privacy intact\nAt YOUR cost structure\nUnder YOUR control\n\n18. The Three Enhancements (SIMPLE DIAGRAM)\nThree boxes:\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - Give LLM access to YOUR documents - Example: IUNR course materials, research papers - Makes it accurate for your domain\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol) - Connect LLM to your tools - Example: Field data, GIS, email, calendar - Extends what it can do\nPersonas/System Prompts - Shape how LLM behaves - Example: “Teaching assistant for environmental science” - Customize for your needs\n19. Why Local Makes Sense for Teaching\n\nStudent data is sensitive (GDPR, privacy)\nRepetitive tasks (grading, feedback)\nCustom course materials (RAG)\nOne-time setup, ongoing value\nNo per-query costs\n\n20. Transition\n\n“Okay, so what can you actually DO with this?”\n“Let’s look at real teaching use cases”\n\n\n\n\n\n21. Section Title\n\n“What Can Local LLMs Do For Teaching?”\n\n22. Use Case 1: Generate Practice Questions (WITH BENCHMARK)\n\nInput: Lecture slides or textbook chapter\nOutput: 10 multiple choice questions with explanations\nWhy local: Course materials often proprietary/sensitive\n\nBenchmark (on same slide):\nChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nLocal DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nPrivacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS\n23. Use Case 2: Student Writing Feedback (WITH BENCHMARK)\n\nInput: Student essay or report\nOutput: Constructive feedback on structure, argument, clarity\nWhy local: Student work is confidential\n\nBenchmark (on same slide):\nChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nLocal DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\nPrivacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS\n24. Use Case 3: Summarize Research (WITH BENCHMARK)\n\nInput: 30-page research paper\nOutput: 1-page summary for students\nWhy local: Can process many papers, no API costs\n\nBenchmark (on same slide):\nChatGPT-4:        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nLocal DeepSeek-r1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nPrivacy: Local WINS | Cost: Local WINS\n25. More Use Cases (Quick List)\nOther tasks that work well locally: - Translate technical content to different reading levels - Create interactive study guides with RAG - Generate grading rubrics - Answer student questions about course materials\n26. The Key Insight\n\nLocal models are “good enough” for teaching tasks\nQuality gap has closed dramatically\nPrivacy advantage is huge\nCost: Hardware once, then unlimited use\n\n27. Transition to Demo\n\n“Let’s see this in action”\n\n\n\n\n\n31. Demo Intro\n\n“Let’s See It In Action”\nI’ll run BOTH ChatGPT and local Ollama\nYOU give me a teaching task\nWe’ll compare results\n\n32. Demo Setup Slide\n\nSplit screen or side-by-side\nSame prompt to both\nReal-time comparison\n(Minimal slide - focus is live demo)\n\n[LIVE DEMO HAPPENS]\nPossible demo tasks: - Generate 5 exam questions from a text snippet - Give feedback on a short student paragraph - Summarize a research abstract\n33. Demo Debrief\n\n“Same capability, different backends”\n“One you control, one you don’t”\n“Both work for teaching tasks”\n\n\n\n\n\n34. Section Title\n\n“Why Control Matters”\n\n35. Two Times You Were Betrayed\nExample 1: WhatsApp Leak - Billions of phone numbers exposed - “You trusted them with your data” - Everyone uses it, personal stakes\nExample 2: Windows 10 Obsolescence - Hardware made “obsolete” by software decision - Environmental waste, e-waste crisis - Forced upgrades, no choice\n36. The Lock-in Pattern (VISUAL)\nSimple diagram:\n         Cognitive Lock-in\n         (I only know THIS)\n              ╱│╲\n             ╱ │ ╲\n   Technical│  │ Institutional\n   (Format) │  │ (Everyone uses it)\n37. Father’s Photo + Global Justice\n\nPhoto: 1998 Linux workshop, Sri Lanka\n“This has always mattered - licensing costs exclude entire regions”\nOpen source = global equity\n\n38. The AI Choice is NOW\n\nIn 2-3 years, everyone locked into ChatGPT like WhatsApp?\nOr will we preserve alternatives?\nThis window won’t stay open forever\nGood news: Open models exist NOW\n\n39. Recipe Callback\n\n“Remember the proprietary recipe?”\n“Would you accept that for cooking?”\n“Then why accept it for AI?”\n\n\n\n\n\n40. Your Use Cases\n\n“What would YOU use local LLMs for in your teaching?”\nQuick brainstorm (show of hands or call-outs)\nCapture 3-5 ideas verbally\nValidate: “Yes, that would work!”\n\n41. Where Are You Locked In?\n\n“Which tools feel hardest to escape?”\nQuick discussion (2-3 people share)\n“That’s the lock-in we’re talking about”\n“Local LLMs can help break some of those chains”\n\n\n\n\n\n42. Return to Fork in the Road\n\n“We started with a choice”\n“Is AI going to own us, or do we own AI?”\n\n43. You Have Options\n\nOpen weight models exist\nHardware is capable (even laptops)\nTools are maturing (Ollama, LM Studio)\nCommunity is growing\nYOU can do this\n\n44. Address the Objection\n\n“I don’t have time to learn this!”\n“Yes, initial investment needed”\n“But: Pays off over time”\n“And: You’re no longer vulnerable”\nCooking callback: “Worth learning to cook vs. proprietary recipes”\n\n45. Start Small\n\nTry ONE thing this month:\n\nInstall Ollama and run a model\nGenerate one set of exam questions locally\nTest a local LLM for summarizing\nExplore LM Studio or similar tools\n\n“You don’t have to switch everything at once”\n\n46.

Proprietary vs Open Weights\nTwo columns:\nLEFT: Proprietary (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) - Runs on their servers - They see your data - You pay subscription - They control access - Can change/remove features\nRIGHT: Open Weights (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) - Runs on YOUR hardware - Your data stays local - One-time hardware cost - You control everything - Stable, predictable\n17. “Good Enough” is Good Enough\n\nYou don’t need the absolute best model\nYou need one that solves YOUR problem\nWith YOUR data privacy intact\nAt YOUR cost structure\nUnder YOUR control\n\n18. The Three Enhancements (SIMPLE DIAGRAM)\nThree boxes:\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - Give LLM access to YOUR documents - Example: IUNR course materials, research papers - Makes it accurate for your domain\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol) - Connect LLM to your tools - Example: Field data, GIS, email, calendar - Extends what it can do\nPersonas/System Prompts - Shape how LLM behaves - Example: “Teaching assistant for environmental science” - Customize for your needs\n19. Why Local Makes Sense for Teaching\n\nStudent data is sensitive (GDPR, privacy)\nRepetitive tasks (grading, feedback)\nCustom course materials (RAG)\nOne-time setup, ongoing value\nNo per-query costs\n\n20. Transition\n\n“Okay, so what can you actually DO with this?”\n“Let’s look at real teaching use cases”"

Debrief\n\n“What patterns do you see?”\n“Where’s the concentration?”\nKey insight: “Collective lock-in”\n\n\n\n\n\n31. Section Title\n\n“We’re At A Fork In The Road”\n\n32. The Key Question (LARGE TEXT)\n\n“Is AI going to own us?”\n“Or are we going to own AI?”\n\n33. Two Paths (SPLIT VISUAL)\nLeft side - Path 1: Corporate Control\n\nThey decide what we can do\nThey set the terms\nWe pay their prices\nWe’re dependent on their decisions\nPattern repeats: Windows → Office → ArcGIS → ChatGPT\n\nRight side - Path 2: Democratic Technology\n\nOpen models anyone can run\nLocal control over your data\nCustomize for your needs\nNot beholden to corporate decisions\nTrue technological sovereignty\n\n34. The Urgency\n\n“This choice happens NOW. In the next 2-3 years.”\n“Will everyone be locked into ChatGPT like WhatsApp?”\n“The window won’t stay open forever”\nGOOD NEWS: Open models exist NOW, hardware is capable NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n35. Section Title\n\n“Understanding LLMs: Not Magic, Technology”\n\n36. What LLMs Are\n\nSophisticated pattern matching, not magic\nLike very advanced autocomplete\nTrained on massive text datasets\nNot “intelligence” - pattern recognition at scale\n\n37. The Last 5 Years (TIMELINE VISUAL)\n\n2019: GPT-2 impressive but limited\n2023: ChatGPT changes everything\n2024-2025: Open models catch up\nKey insight: Gap closing FAST\n\n38. Open Weights vs Open Source\n\nOpen weights: You can download and run the model\nDifferent from fully open source (training code, data)\nBut still: YOU control it, not a company\nExamples: Llama, DeepSeek-r1, Mistral\n\n39. Enhancing LLMs - The Ecosystem (DIAGRAM)\nThree components:\n\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n\nGive LLM access to YOUR documents\nExample: IUNR course materials\n\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol)\n\nConnect LLM to your tools and data\nExample: Field data, GIS systems\n\nPersonas/System Prompts\n\nShape how LLM behaves\nExample: “You are a teaching assistant for environmental science”\n\n\n40. Why Understanding Matters\n\nNot magic → Technology you can shape\nNot monolithic → Modular components\nNot proprietary only → Open alternatives exist\nNot all-or-nothing → Right tool for each task\n\n\n\n\n\n41. Section Title\n\n“LLMs: Liberation Tools”\n\n42. The Double Message\n\n“Yes: LLMs are another lock-in risk”\n“BUT ALSO: LLMs make technology ACCESSIBLE”\n“You can WIELD difficult tools without mastering proprietary interfaces”\n\n43. The Promise\n\nUse tools more easily with AI assistance\nBuild custom solutions for YOUR needs\nDemocratize technical capability\nBreak down barriers to open source adoption\n\n44. Teaching Use Cases\n\nGenerate practice questions from lecture materials\nProvide feedback on student writing\nTranslate technical content to different levels\nSummarize research papers for students\nCreate interactive study guides\nAssist with grading rubrics\n\n45.

GrüentAI Connection\n\n“We’re making this real for teaching”\n“We’re here as a resource”\nBrief mention of project\n\n\n\n\n\n47. Demo Intro\n\n“Let’s See It In Action”\nYOU run both ChatGPT and local Ollama\nTHEY give you prompts\n\n48. Demo Setup Slide\n\nShow: Same task, different backend\nShow: LLM helps you use open source tools\n(Minimal slide - focus is on live demo)\n\n[LIVE DEMO HAPPENS]\n49. Demo Debrief\n\n“Same technology, different products”\n“YOU control one of them”\n\n\n\n\n\n50. Return to Cooking\n\nShow proprietary recipe card again\n“Would you accept this for cooking?”\n“Then why accept it for software?”\n\n51. Address the Objection\n\n“I don’t have time to learn this!”\n“Yes, initial investment needed”\n“BUT: Pays off many-fold over time”\n“AND: You’re no longer vulnerable”\n\n52. The Choice\n\n“We’re at the fork in the road”\n“Which path do we take?”\n“Switching costs are real…”\n“But so is the cost of staying locked in”\n\n53. Action Step\n\n“Try ONE new open alternative this month”\n“Start small”\n“Learn the basics”\n“Reclaim your sovereignty”\n\n54.
